  Reports from Z-Wave commands

  When you send a command in Z-Wave you will receive a report back.

  ## When Things Go Well

  There are two primary reports that are returned when sending a command.

  The first is `:command` report and the second is an `:ack_response` report.
  These both will have a status of `:complete`.

  Normally, an `:ack_response` report is returned when you set a value on a
  device. This means the device received the command and is processing it,
  not that the device has already processed it. You might have to go read the
  value back after setting it if you want to make the device ran the set
  based command.

  A `:command` report type is returned often after reading a value from a
  device. This report will have its `:command` field filled with a Z-Wave
  command.

  ```elixir
  case Grizzly.send_command(node_id, command, command_args, command_opts) do
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :command} = report} ->
      # do something withe report.command
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :ack_response}} ->
      # do whatever
  end
  ```

  ## Queued Commands

  When sending a command to a device that sleeping, normally battery powered
  devices, the command will be queued internally. The command will still be
  considered `:inflight` as it has not reached the device yet. You know when
  a command has been queued when the report's `:status` field is `:inflight`
  and the `:type` field is `:queued_delayed`. Fields to help you manage queued
  commands are `:command_ref`, `:queued_delay`, and `:node_id`

  During the command's queued lifetime the system sends pings back to the
  caller to ensure that the low level connection is still established. This
  also provides an updated delayed time before the device wakes up.

  ```elixir
  case Grizzly.send_command(node_id, command, command_args, command_opts) do
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :inflight, type: :queued_delay}} ->
      # the command was just queued
  end
  ```

  Once the command has been queued the calling process will receive messages
  about the queued command like so:

  ```elixir
  {:grizzly, :report, %Report{}}
  ```

  This report can take two forms. One for a completed queued command and one
  for a queued ping.


  ```elixir
  def handle_info({:grizzly, :report, report}, state) do
    case report do
      %Grizzly.Report{status: :inflight, type: :queued_ping} ->
        # handle the ping if you want
        # an updated queue delay will be found in the :queued_delay
        # field of the report
      %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :command, queued: true} ->
        # here if the :queued field is marked has true and the report is
        # complete that will indicate a command has made it to the sleeping
        # device and the device has received the command
      %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :timeout, queued: true} ->
        # The woke up and the controller sent the command but for reason
        # the command's processing timed out
    end
  end
  ```

  ## Timeouts

  If sending the command times out you will get a command with the `:type` of
  `:timeout`

  ```elixir
  case Grizzly.send_command(node_id, command, command_args, command_opts) do
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :timeout}} ->
      # handle the timeout
  end
  ```

  The reason why this is considered okay is because the command that was sent
  was valid and we were able to establish a connect to the desired device but
  it just did not provide any report back.

  ## Full Example

  The below example shows the various ways one might match after calling
  `Grizzly.send_command/4`.

  ```elixir
  case Grizzly.send_command(node_id, command, command_args, command_opts) do
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :command} = report} ->
      handle_complete_report(report)
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :ack_response} = report} ->
      handle_complete_report(report)
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :complete, type: :timeout} = report} ->
      handle_timeout(report)
    {:ok, %Grizzly.Report{status: :inflight, type: :queued} = report} ->
      handle_queued_command(report)
  end
  ```

  note: the `handle_*` functions will need to implemented and are only used in
  the example for illustration purposes

  All the data for the status and type of a report.

  Fields

    - `:status` - this indicates if the report is complete, inflight, or
      timed out
    - `:type` - this indicates if the report is contains a command or information
      about being queued.
    - `:command` - if the status is `:complete` and the type is `:command` then
      this field will contain a Z-Wave command in the report.
    - `:transmission_stats` - provides transmission stats for the command that
      was sent
    - `:queued_delay` - the delay time remaining if the report type is
      `:queued_delay` or `:queued_ping`
    - `:command_ref` - a reference to the command. This is mostly useful for
      tracking queued commands
    - `:node_id` - the node the report is responding from
    - `:queued` - this flag marks if the command was ever queued before
      completing
