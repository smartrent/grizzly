  # Server for keeping track of the inclusion status.

  # Separating this into it's own process allows for error isolation between the
  # inclusion server and the status of the inclusion process. The reason for the
  # isolation is if the inclusion server crashes for whatever reason the Z-Wave
  # controller will be in an non-operable state and there would be no why for
  # the runtime to know this. Therefore, the status is kept separate from the
  # more complex code around managing the communication back and forth during
  # an inclusion/exclusion of a Z-Wave device. The goal of this is to provide
  # system recoverability after a crash during inclusion/exclusion.
